# Computer-Organisation-Laboratory-CS39001-IIT-Kgp
This was one of my assignments (to be done in a pair) in the Computer Organisation Laboratory (CS39001) at IIT Kharagpur. We had to design our own ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) inspired by MIPS32. We had to implement our own Data Path using Verilog. Finally, we were given two codes which where to be run in an FPGA running our Mini MIPS32.

**Apart from the verilog files, two BRAMs need to be created, one for the Data cache and the other for Instruction Cache. For the final tasks (running 2 codes on FPGA on our own Mini MIPS32), the files to be loaded in the respective caches are present in the [Codes To Be Run On FPGA](Codes%20To%20Be%20Run%20On%20FPGA/) folder.**
