# Computer-Organisation-Laboratory-CS39001-IIT-Kgp
This was one of my assignments (to be done in a pair) in the Computer Organisation Laboratory (CS39001) at IIT Kharagpur. We had to design our own ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) inspired by MIPS32. We had to implement our own Data Path using Verilog. Finally, we were given two codes which where to be run in an FPGA running our Mini MIPS32.
